# Budget-Tracker

## Description
This budget tracker application is a budgeting tool that takes in transaction data from the user and charts the results. The budget tracker still works when offline, so any transactions entered when offline will be carried over once it is back online. This program can also be installed as a progressive web application (instructions below).
